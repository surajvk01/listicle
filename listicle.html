                    <h2>Italian soda at Bytes</h2>
                    <a href="">Near Block A, CCET(DG), Sector 26</a>
                    <p>When's the last time you've had an Italian soda? It had been a while for me, but I wanted to join
                        my friend for a non-caffeinated beverage at Bytes and I became reaquainted with the combination
                        of fizzy water and artificial fruit syrup. Italian sodas are not so sweet as a normal soda and
                        not so boring as a flavored carbonated water. The Italian sodas at Bytes also have no cream in
                        them (or maybe they do if you ask; I haven't tried), which makes it a nice coffee shop
                        alternative for the times when you're feeling a refreshing drink that doesn't have caffeine or
                        milk.</p>
                    <div><span>Recommendation:</span> Raspberry Italian soda</div>

                    <a href="">Near Block A, CCET(DG), Sector 26</a>
                    <p>Nubz is cafe/bar newly opened in sector 26. The interiors are done well with a mixture of modern
                        age designing with classic old school comfort.
                        The place is divided into three areas basically which is the indoor lounge, the outdoor and
                        rooftop. <br>
                        The inner seating area is shady and gives a classic tone to the restaurant where as the outdoor
                        seating is comparatively more modern with Graffiti's and funky wall frames. <br>
                        An ideal place to chill and relax. <br><br>

                    <p>I can't tell you whether CoHo has a particularly amazing Vanilla Bean Latte, only because CoHo is
                        the only place I've ever ordered a Vanilla Bean Latte from. I'm not even totally sure I know
                        what a Vanilla Bean Latte is supposed to taste like. What I do know is the Vanilla Bean Latte I
                        ordered on a whim from CoHo was delicious.</p>
