        <h2>Lassi From Punjab</h2>
        <p> Lassi, a creamy, frothy yogurt-based drink, blended with water and various fruits or seasonings (such as
            salt or sugar), that originated in Punjab, India. There are many varieties, but most are either sweet or
            salted; the former is blended with curd or fruit (such as mango) or is whisked with sugar, whereas the
            latter is mixed with salt and/or spices, typically cumin or cardamom. Traditionally, lassi is served in a
            handleless clay cup called a kulhar, and extra malai (clotted cream) may be spooned on top before serving.
            The drink has spread to the rest of the world, especially to Great Britain and countries tied to the former
            British Empire. </p>

        <h2>Chaach From Haryana</h2>
        <p> Taking on from its neighbour, Haryana has its own variant of lassi which is salted called chaach. A watery
            counterpart of the lassi, it is more palatable to some. Lightly flavoured with ginger and mint, it’s famous
            in southern parts of the country as well. It’s a drink which is truly diverse and unifies the country at the
            same time! Chaach is made by churning yogurt (curds/dahi) and cold water together in a pot, using a
            hand-held instrument called madhani (whipper). This can be consumed plain or seasoned with a variety of
            spices. Chaas can be made from fresh yogurt, and the natural flavour of such chaas is mildly sweet. This
            type of chaas is very close to lassi, with two major differences: chaas is more dilute (with water) than
            lassi and unlike lassi, chaas does not have added sugar. </p>

        <h2>Sattu Sharbat From Bihar</h2>
        <p> Sattu Sharbat is one of my favorite childhood summer drinks. This sweet delight that originated in Bihar is
            known for its cooling properties. It is popular across the country and has its own variations in states like
            Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. Once popular as a rural delicacy, Sattu Sharbat eventually caught
            the attention of the urban population. Sattu powder is basically made with roasted black chanas which is
            used to make the drink. It is also used as a condiment in various other dishes like Litti Chokha, Laddoos
            and even Parathas. </p>
